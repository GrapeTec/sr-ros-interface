Examples
========

The sr\_example package contains examples on how to use our hands from
c++ or python code.

We're providing a `high level wrapper <../sr_robot_commander/README>`__
around our robots to make the interfacing easier for non-ROS people.

You can find some examples showing you the different functionalities of
the library in the `scripts/sr\_example
folder <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/scripts/sr_example>`__.
Use cases are given for the
`hand <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/scripts/sr_example/hand_examples>`__
and for `the hand and
arm <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/scripts/sr_example/hand_and_arm_examples>`__.
To Run these examples, the robot(s) should be launched first, followed
by MoveIt. Instructions for this process can be found
`here <../sr_robot_launch/README.md>`__

For the full functionalities of the hand you can interface directly
through the ROS interface. You'll find the python examples in the
`scripts/sr\_example/advanced
folder <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/scripts/sr_example/advanced>`__,
and c++ examples in the `src
folder <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/src>`__.

Descriptions of the function of each example can be found commented at
the top of each script.
