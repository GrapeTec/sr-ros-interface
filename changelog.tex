\item \textbf{19/06/2012 - rev. 364}: Better mixed position velocity controllers.
\item \textbf{19/04/2012 - rev. 361}: Hand with Biotacs model added
\item \textbf{19/03/2012 - rev. 334}: Reorganised the code in different stacks. Removed some packages from the shadow\_robot stack to put them in either sr\_contrib, sr\_config, sr\_teleop, sr\_visualisation, sr\_demo stacks. We're keeping only the core packages in this stack for easier release / maintenance.
