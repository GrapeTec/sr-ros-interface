Examples
========

We are providing a `high level
wrapper <../sr_robot_commander/README.html>`__ around our robots to make
the interfacing easier for non-ROS people. The
`sr\_example <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/>`__
package contains examples on how to use it.

Use cases are given for:

-  [Hand]
   (https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr\_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr\_example/scripts/sr\_example/hand\_examples)
-  [Arm]
   (https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr\_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr\_example/scripts/sr\_example/arm\_examples)
-  [Hand and arm]
   (https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr\_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr\_example/scripts/sr\_example/hand\_and\_arm\_examples)

To run these examples, the robot should be launched first (instructions
for this can be found `here <../sr_robot_launch/README.html>`__)

In order to access the full functionality of the hand, you can interface
with it directly through the ROS interface. You can find python examples
in the
`advanced <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/scripts/sr_example/advanced>`__
folder and c++ examples in the
`src <https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_example/src>`__
folder.

Description of each example can be found in the comment at the top of
each script.
